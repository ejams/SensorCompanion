# SensorCompanion
Capstone Project 2018

A companion Android application to go along with the Arduino device I have configured to interface with and transmit data from a sensor giving off an analog signal in the form of a voltage.

The application graphs the data in real-time while providing other analysis of the data in the form of statistics being dynamically calculated. The data can also be exported as a .CSV file for later use.

**NOTE**
This project was completed over the course of three months on top of other courses, with no previous knowledge of Android (other than experience with Java), Arduino/circuits or the Bluetooth protocol, and this project was entirely individual so some of it is rough.
